title: useFlashcard hook
---

The `useFlashcard` hook is a custom React hook built to manage the state and behavior of a single flashcard component. It provides a flexible API to control the flip state, direction, and behavior of a flashcard, making it ideal for creating interactive flashcard experiences. 
You can use this hook with the `Flashcard` component to have more granular control over the flip state and handle flipping logic. You can also customize it for manual or automatic flipping, various animation directions, and callback functions.

## Usage

The `useFlashcard` hook takes an optional configuration object and returns an object with properties and methods to control the flashcard's behavior. It is typically used to manage the state of a `Flashcard` component, but it can also be used independently for custom implementations.

The hook is included in the package and can be imported as follows:

```tsx
import { useFlashcard, type FlipState, type FlipDirection } from 'react-quizlet-flashcard';
```

### Basic Example

```tsx
'use client'

import { useFlashcard, type FlipState, Flashcard } from 'react-quizlet-flashcard';
import 'react-quizlet-flashcard/dist/index.css'

const MyFlashcard = () => {
  const flipHook = useFlashcard({
    onFlip: (state: FlipState) => {
      console.log(`Flipped to ${state}`);
    },
  });

  return (
    <Flashcard
      flipHook={flipHook}
      front={{ html: <div>Front Content</div> }}
      back={{ html: <div>Back Content</div> }}
    />
  );
};
```

In this example, the hook manages the flip state, and the `onFlip` callback logs the new state whenever the card is flipped.

## Hook API

### Input Parameters

The `useFlashcard` hook accepts a single optional parameter, `UseFlashcardProps`, which configures the hook's behavior:

| Property         | Type                       | Default    | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `manualFlip?`     | `boolean`                  | `false`    | If `true`, disables automatic flipping on click, requiring manual calls to `flip()`. |
| `disableFlip?`    | `boolean`                  | `false`    | If `true`, disables all flipping, making the card static.                   |
| `flipDirection?`  | `FlipDirection`            | `'bt'`     | Specifies the animation direction for flipping. Options: `'rtl'`, `'ltr'`, `'tb'`, `'bt'`. |
| `onFlip?`         | `(state: FlipState) => void` | `undefined` | Optional callback invoked when the card flips, receiving the new `FlipState`. |

### Return Value

The hook returns a `UseFlashcard` object with the following properties and methods. Some of these properties are not relevant outside of the `Flashcard` component, but they are available for advanced use cases:

| Property/Method    | Type                       | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `state`            | `FlipState`                | The current side of the flashcard (`FlipState.Front` or `FlipState.Back`). |
| `manualFlip`       | `boolean`                  | Reflects the `manualFlip` prop value passed to the hook.                    |
| `disableFlip`      | `boolean`                  | Reflects the `disableFlip` prop value passed to the hook.                   |
| `flipDirection`    | `FlipDirection`            | The current flip direction (e.g., `'bt'`, `'rtl'`).                         |
| `flip`             | `(state?: FlipState) => void` | Function to flip the card to the opposite side or a specified `FlipState`. |
| `resetCardState`   | `() => void`               | Resets the card to its initial state (`FlipState.Front`).                   |

### Types

- **FlipState**: An enum representing the card's display state:
  - `FlipState.Front` (`'front'`): The front side is visible.
  - `FlipState.Back` (`'back'`): The back side is visible.
- **FlipDirection**: A type defining the flip animation direction:
  - `'rtl'`: Right-to-left flip.
  - `'ltr'`: Left-to-right flip.
  - `'tb'`: Top-to-bottom flip.
  - `'bt'`: Bottom-to-top flip (default).


## Best Practices

- **Use TypeScript**: The hook is written in TypeScript and provides type safety for all inputs and outputs. Ensure your project uses TypeScript to leverage these benefits.
- **Handle Callbacks**: Use the `onFlip` callback to track user interactions or trigger side effects, such as logging or updating application state.
- **Control Flipping**: For controlled flashcards, always set `manualFlip` to `true` and provide a `flipHook` to the `Flashcard` component to avoid unexpected behavior.
- **Optimize Performance**: The hook uses `useCallback` and `useMemo` to memoize functions and values, ensuring optimal performance. Avoid unnecessary re-renders by passing stable references to props like `onFlip`.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the `Flashcard` component's accessibility features (e.g., ARIA attributes) are used correctly when integrating with `useFlashcard`.

## Notes

- The hook is optimized for use with the `Flashcard` component but can be used independently for custom implementations requiring flip state management.
- The default flip direction is `'bt'` (bottom-to-top). Use the `flipDirection` option to customize the animation.
- When `disableFlip` is `true`, the `flip` method does nothing, ensuring the card remains static.
- The `resetCardState` method is useful for resetting the card to its initial state (`FlipState.Front`) when navigating between cards in a `FlashcardArray`**.**
