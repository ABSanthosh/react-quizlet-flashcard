This guide outlines how to contribute to the `react-quizlet-flashcard` project, which consists of two main parts: the documentation site in the `/docs` directory and the component library in the `/package` directory. Follow the instructions below to set up your development environment, make changes, and test your contributions.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install dependencies at the root level:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ABSanthosh/react-quizlet-flashcard.git
cd react-quizlet-flashcard
```

The project is split into two main directories:
- `/docs`: Contains the Next.js-based documentation site using Fumadocs.
- `/package`: Contains the `react-quizlet-flashcard` component library.

## Contributing to Documentation (/docs)

The documentation site is built with Next.js and Fumadocs, located in the `/docs` directory. It includes API documentation, usage examples, and demos.

### Setup

Navigate to the `/docs` directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd docs
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server to preview changes locally at `http://localhost:3000`:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This uses Next.js with Turbo mode for faster development.

### Making Changes

- **Documentation Files**: Edit MDX files in `/docs/content/docs` (e.g., `flashcard/index.mdx`, `flashcard-array/index.mdx`) to update content.
- **Demos**: Modify demo components in `/docs/content/demos` (e.g., `flashcard-demos.tsx`, `flashcard-array-demos.tsx`) to showcase library features.
- **Styling**: Update SCSS files in `/docs/app/styles` for custom styles, ensuring consistency with `_mixins.scss` and `theme.scss`.
- **Routing and Layout**: Adjust layouts in `/docs/app` (e.g., `layout.tsx`, `page.tsx`) for structural changes.

Always import the `react-quizlet-flashcard` library from the `.yalc` folder to ensure the latest local build is used:

```tsx
import { FlashcardArray, useFlashcardArray } from '../../.yalc/react-quizlet-flashcard';
```

### Updating the Library Dependency

If you make changes to the component library in `/package`, update the `.yalc` dependency in `/docs`:

```bash
cd ../package
npm run rebuild
cd ../docs
npm run yalc:update
```

This rebuilds the library and updates the `.yalc` folder in `/docs`.


## Contributing to the Component Library (/package)

The component library, located in `/package`, contains the core `Flashcard` and `FlashcardArray` components, along with their hooks and styles.

### Setup

Navigate to the `/package` directory and install dependencies:

```bash
cd package
npm install
```

### Running the Development Server

Use Ladle to run a development server for testing components via stories:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts a server rendering components from `*.stories.tsx` files in `/package/src/stories`.

### Making Changes

- **Components**: Edit `Flashcard` and `FlashcardArray` in `/package/src/components` (e.g., `index.tsx`, `types.ts`).
- **Hooks**: Update `useFlashcard.ts` and `useFlashcardArray.ts` in `/package/src/hooks` for state management logic.
- **Styles**: Modify SCSS files in `/package/src/components/*/style.scss` or `/package/src/styles` for component-specific or global styles.
- **Stories**: Add or update stories in `/package/src/stories` (e.g., `Flashcard.stories.tsx`, `FlashcardArray.stories.tsx`) to demonstrate component functionality.
- **Tests**: Update unit tests in `/package/src/components/*/Flashcard.test.tsx` and `FlashcardArray.test.tsx`.

### Testing with Ladle Stories

Ladle stories (in `/package/src/stories`) provide an interactive way to test components. After making changes, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

View the stories in your browser to verify component behavior.

### Building and Publishing Locally

To build the library and publish it locally for use in `/docs`:

```bash
npm run rebuild
```

This compiles the TypeScript code, builds the library with Vite, and publishes it to the `.yalc` folder for local testing.

## Submitting Contributions

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository and create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make changes and commit with clear messages.
3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request to the `refactor` branch.
4. Reference any related issues in the pull request description.

### Code Style and Linting

- **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` in `/package` to check for linting errors, or `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix issues.
- **Formatting**: Use Prettier with `npm run format` to check formatting, or `npm run format:fix` to apply fixes.
- **TypeScript**: Ensure all code is type-safe and adheres to the configurations in `tsconfig.json`.
