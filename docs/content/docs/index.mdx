## Introduction

react-quizlet-flashcard is a React library for creating interactive flashcard arrays, inspired by Quizlet. It provides a simple way to display flashcards, navigate through them, and customize their appearance and behavior.

react-quizlet-flashcard has different parts. Two main components: `FlashcardArray` and `Flashcard` and
a supporting hook for each component: `useFlashcardArray` and `useFlashcard`.

Both `FlashcardArray` and `Flashcard` use these hooks internally to give you the default behavior and you 
can pass you own instances of these hooks to customize the behavior.
